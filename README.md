# kubeflow-devx-post-merge-tests

This repository is used to run midstream training-operator notebooks as e2e tests on kubeflow sdk (requiring a runner bigger than standard org GH runner) on PRs. Jobs are triggered from that midstream repo and currently cannot be invoked directly from here.

Please do not remove/change anything within this repo, before first checking with the Kubeflow DevX team.
